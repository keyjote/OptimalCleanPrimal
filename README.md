# OptimalCleanPrimal
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product 
of two smaller natural numbers. They are used heavily in cryptography because they 
are heavy to factorize. But before we can do some more serious encryption than ROT13, 
we need to figure which the prime numbers are.

**The task:** Create a program that enumerates the first N prime numbers.

Examples: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29 (The first 10 prime numbers.)

*Focus Option A:* Make your code as clean and readable as possible.

*Focus Option B:* Make you algorithm as efficient as you can.

**Bonus task:** Calculate as many prime numbers as possible and multiply the two highest.
